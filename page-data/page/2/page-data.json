The project was about building a simple recurrent neural network using numpy and it was a part of the Sequence Models course of Andrew Ng's awesome Deep Learning Specialization series on Coursera."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/enrolling-in-coursera-for-free","categorySlug":"/category/coursera/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Enrolling in Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization MOOC for free","date":"2018-05-06T22:12:03.284Z","category":"Coursera","description":"This year, I enrolled in Andrew Ng's awesome Deep Learning Specialization series consisting of 5 different courses on Coursera; all for free. While chatting with people about this, I realized that people usually don't know to what extend you can make use of the course material when you enroll for free. So I wanted to share my experiences here and I hope it helps someone."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/kaggle-munich-meetup","categorySlug":"/category/kaggle/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Kaggle Munich Meetup","date":"2018-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","category":"kaggle","description":"Yesterday was my third week in Munich and to join the community of the city's machine learning peeps, I went to Kaggle Munich's meetup, held at the Google office."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"currentPage":2,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":8,"prevPagePath":"/page/1","nextPagePath":"/page/3","hasPrevPage":true,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","4120999787"]}
