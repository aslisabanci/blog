Maybe someday Iâ€™ll get my hands on this while dabbling in a Kaggle competition - Iâ€™d like to see what advantages it would bring me.</p>\n<p>The second talk was about Hierarchical Temporal Memory, which is an experimental approach to machine learning where the neurons are different than the usual neural network neurons most of us are used to. This approach is inspired by our neocortex and it could have some advantages for certain types of problems. I donâ€™t think I will get my hands on this in the short term, but still, it was interesting to learn about this new way of thinking. The slides of this talk are <a href=\"https://github.com/ConnorJL/Kaggle-Munich-HTM\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here on github</a>, if youâ€™d like to check them out.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hands-on-kaggling\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#hands-on-kaggling\" aria-label=\"hands on kaggling permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Hands on Kaggling</h2>\n<p>Although two of the talks were engaging, the most fun part of the meetup was the hands on Kaggle hacking session. I was curious about this <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Avito Demand Prediction Challenge competition</a> so I started a team, by acting as the noob seed and then we became a small team of three, when two other Kagglers joined me. We started by taking a look at the existing kernels and checked out some exploratory data analysis posts and some model implementations. We then submitted a super basic prediction output - just to have a baseline result to improve later on :]</p>\n<h2 id=\"verdict\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#verdict\" aria-label=\"verdict permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>VerdictðŸ˜›</h2>\n<p>All in all, this was a super fun and friendly meetup. I am looking forward to the next one and I absolutely recommend it to you too, if you happen to be around Munich at that time and are keen to spend a good 3-4 hours thinking of and with data.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/kaggle-munich-meetup","tagSlugs":["/tag/kaggle/","/tag/meetup/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2018-05-06T00:00:00.000Z","description":"Yesterday was my third week in Munich and to join the community of the city's machine learning peeps, I went to Kaggle Munich's meetup, held at the Google office.","tags":["kaggle","meetup"],"title":"Kaggle Munich Meetup","socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/kaggle-munich-meetup"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","4120999787"]}
