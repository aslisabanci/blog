While I was working on building the pipeline, the model was iteratively developed and optimized by my data scientist team mates in parallel. The project in general consisted of loosely coupled microservices. Our pipeline would be interacting with these services through messaging services of the AWS platform.</p>\n<p>During the model training phase, the pipeline would be used to preprocess and structure the data as per the taste buds of our machine learning model. Then, during the inference phase, the pipeline would get the input data; apply the same preprocessing and structuring steps; feed this input into the model; get its inference and make it available for other components’ digestion on this ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Let’s go over these pipelines, component by component:</p>\n<h3 id=\"data-collection-and-enrichment\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#data-collection-and-enrichment\" aria-label=\"data collection and enrichment permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Data Collection and Enrichment</h3>\n<p>Our core proprietary data that was collected from different internal sources. Because of this, it needed standardization, normalization and some cleanup with respect to our domain experts’ knowledge. Along with these tasks, enriching this core with 3rd party providers’ data was one of the main and ongoing tasks of this project - as the core data kept getting updated and our enrichment ideas kept continuing.</p>\n<p>The scope of this component was:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evaluating 3rd party data providers with respect to their technical API specs</li>\n<li>Collecting data from the chosen providers through API requests or through custom processes like FTP deliveries</li>\n<li>Versioning and managing the updates on this continuously growing ground truth data</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"data-storage\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#data-storage\" aria-label=\"data storage permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Data Storage</h3>\n<p>Different components of our pipeline dealt with different types of data. Some of them were highly relational while some were highly unstructured and document-style. So, I used both relational and non-relational database systems for storage.</p>\n<p>Designing the relational data structure was an ongoing process and my main objective was to keep the data “simply-enough” structured; thus easy to maintain. While evaluating on which database system to use and how best to store the data, I kept discussing questions like these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What types of queries do we want to perform on this data?</li>\n<li>How often are we going to want to do this?</li>\n<li>What additions or updates can we foresee on this data?</li>\n<li>What’s our scaling needs?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"quantitative-and-qualitative-checks-on-data\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#quantitative-and-qualitative-checks-on-data\" aria-label=\"quantitative and qualitative checks on data permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Quantitative and Qualitative Checks on Data</h3>\n<p>We had certain criteria on our minds, when evaluating whether to go with a 3rd party provider’s data or not.

To determine our standardization algorithms and processes; I first worked together with our domain experts.

Our machine learning model was able to digest batch input. Thus, for efficiency, the input messages on SQS contained bundled requests. It was the pipeline’s job to unbundle these; do the preprocessing steps separately for each input; and when all the processing is done, bundle the data into a ready-to-be-consumed format and feed this as a batch into our model.</p>\n<h3 id=\"outputting-the-predictions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#outputting-the-predictions\" aria-label=\"outputting the predictions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Outputting the predictions</h3>\n<p>Our model’s predictions were to be consumed by other microservices on our ecosystem. Just like the input, this communication was also carried over AWS SQS messaging platform.</p>\n<p>As a final note; this project opened my eyes to the reality of building machine learning applications. I experienced that 90% of our project was about getting the training data right. Because of this, most of the effort is rightfully spent on this matter to get a high performing model in the end.</p>\n<p>Afterwards, when it’s time to put this application on production, the performance of the pipeline gets the spotlight. If our end-to-end pipeline could not complete the steps of enriching &#x26; preprocessing the input data and getting the model’s inference in a timely manner, this would be a total showstopper. As Miles Davis puts it: <em>“Time isn’t the main thing. It’s the only thing.”</em></p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/end-to-end-machinelearning-pipeline-microservice","tagSlugs":["/tag/aws/","/tag/data-engineering/","/tag/machine-learning/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-30-05T22:12:03.284Z","description":"In one of my projects, my work focused on building end-to-end machine learning pipelines for training and inference phases of a machine learning model.
