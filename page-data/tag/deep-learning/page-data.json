The project was about building a simple recurrent neural network using numpy and it was a part of the Sequence Models course of Andrew Ng's awesome Deep Learning Specialization series on Coursera."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"DeepLearning","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/deep-learning","nextPagePath":"/tag/deep-learning/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","4120999787"]}
