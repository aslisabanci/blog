I wasn't after a good score but I just wanted to build a neural network with Keras from end to end and get predictions from it."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/generating-random-turkish-names-with-rnn","categorySlug":"/category/deep-learning/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Generating random Turkish first names with a super basic RNN","date":"2018-06-06T22:12:03.284Z","category":"DeepLearning","description":"Inspired by the mini 'Dinosaur name generator' project I did a while ago, I wanted to re-use the core code (with some modifications and refactorings of my own) and try to generate Turkish first names. The project was about building a simple recurrent neural network using numpy and it was a part of the Sequence Models course of Andrew Ng's awesome Deep Learning Specialization series on Coursera."}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/posts/enrolling-in-coursera-for-free","categorySlug":"/category/coursera/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Enrolling in Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization MOOC for free","date":"2018-05-06T22:12:03.284Z","category":"Coursera","description":"This year, I enrolled in Andrew Ng's awesome Deep Learning Specialization series consisting of 5 different courses on Coursera; all for free. While chatting with people about this, I realized that people usually don't know to what extend you can make use of the course material when you enroll for free. So I wanted to share my experiences here and I hope it helps someone."}}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"deep-learning","currentPage":0,"postsLimit":4,"postsOffset":0,"prevPagePath":"/tag/deep-learning","nextPagePath":"/tag/deep-learning/page/1","hasPrevPage":false,"hasNextPage":false}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","4120999787"]}
