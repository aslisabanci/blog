Not a biggie, but I wanted to share my little Jupyter notebook on [my github repo](https://github.com/aslisabanci/kaggle_colab), which you can just copy and have your Kaggle environment quickly set up on Google Colab. 

## Get your things ready💼
First sign up for [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) (which is for free). 

Then go ahead and get your API token from your [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) account. You will find this under your Profile > Account section. Kaggle will create a JSON file and you'll download it on your machine. 

## Run the commands on the notebook🏃‍♀️
Create a notebook or just copy mine and there you can run these commands to install the Kaggle framework. After that, handle the authentication between Google Colab and Kaggle and start using the Kaggle API to list / search competitions / datasets, download the data on your virtual machine.

## Enjoy🤸‍♀️
After you have your data ready, install the frameworks you need on your virtual machine and take off with your machine learning adventures, running on Google's GPUs for free.
